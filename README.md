# uQueueService
#### uQueueService is a modified version of QueueService, made by ___RequiredModule___
#### Here is the original [page](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/queueservice-a-simple-module-for-all-your-queuing-needs/723074)

uQueueService is a module made to make queueing up players for teleportation easier and more sleek by turning Queues into an object, which automatically handles things like countdown, player count checks, and even teleport data. It also comes with its own events, which the developer can use to their ability to make custom countdowns and teleport screens.

This module is still in development. Please send feedback if needed!
I have provided you the source code for only uQueueService in GitHub. This module uses the Signal module and the Janitor module, which can be found inside of the rbxm file.
